= Crosscompile BAOS SDK for Raspbian

== Cross-compile

=== Install dependencies

The SDK need:

* CMake >= 3.0 +
  http://www.cmake.org/

[source]
----
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y install cmake
----

* Boost C++ (Header only) +
  http://www.boost.org/

[source]
----
sudo apt-get -y install libboost-all-dev
----

=== Install toolchain

Download the toolchain to your development machine (*PC x86 Linux*)

[source]
----
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/archive/master.tar.gz
----

Install the toolchain to /opt/toolchains/raspberrypi

[source]
----
# Remove a possible older version from the toolchain.
rm -f -r /opt/toolchains/raspberrypi

# Unpack it and move it to /opt/toolchains/raspberrypi
tar -xzf master.tar.gz
mkdir -p /opt/toolchains
mv tools-master /opt/toolchains/raspberrypi
----

For legal reasons the toolchain does not contain the boost include files. We use version from /usr/include (e.g. version 1.54.0)

[source]
----
# set a soft link to boost
# (because in the toolchain are no boost files and set boost root to /usr/include not work)
cd /opt/toolchains/raspberrypi/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/arm-linux-gnueabihf/include/c++/4.8.3
ln -s /usr/include/boost/ boost
----


=== Build

[NOTE]
====
Before building, its recommended to open a new terminal to ensure a clean and fresh set of environment variables
====


* Switch into the designated folder for the baosSDK 
+ 
-----
cd
mkdir baosSDK
cd baosSDK
-----
* Clone the github project: `git clone https://github.com/weinzierl-engineering/baos.git .`

[source]
----
# compile it
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/raspbian-toolchain.cmake -DWZSDK_SAMPLES=1 -DWZSDK_STATIC=1 -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
make -j5
----

[source]
----
# alternative: theres a build script available
chmod u+x build_raspbian.sh
build_raspbian.sh
----


== Run the samples under the Raspberry Pi

=== Preparation

Raspbian with enabled ssh daemon is required on the Paspberry PI.
See also http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/quick-start-guide/


=== Copy sample to Raspberry

Open a ssh connection and copy the samples to the Raspberry PI in the /tmp folder

Open a new terminal (we named it terminal 2)
[source]
----
# open a ssh connection to your Raspberry PI
ssh pi@192.168.1.33
----

In the other terminal (we named it terminal 1)

[source]
----
# cd to the compiled samples
cd PATH_TO_BAOS_SDK/build_raspbian/bin

# copy it to the /tmp folder
scp sample_BaosEnumerator pi@192.168.1.33:/tmp
----

Now we are ready to run the BAOS samples. In terminal 2:

.Search for BAOS devices via IP
[source]
----
cd /tmp
sample_BaosEnumerator
----

.Test FT1.2 BAOS connection e.g. kBerry
[source]
----
cd /tmp
sample_BaosSerial
----


== kBerry

=== Preperation

==== Connection

Connect the Weinzierl kBerry BAOS Module with the Raspberry PI.

==== Using the UART

The default usage of the UART Interface is serial console.
To use the UART we must turning off the UART functioning as a serial console.

[WARNING]
====
The Raspberry Pi 3 does not use the correct baud rate in Raspian out of the box, so kBerry will
not work. To fix this, the overlay pi3-miniuart-bt-overlay must be activated.
[source]
----
sudo sh -c "echo dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt >>/boot/config.txt"
----
====

Open /boot/cmdline.txt and remove *console=ttyAMA0,115200* from the file
For Raspbian Jessie and newer the entry is *console=serial0,115200*
[source]
----
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
----

[NOTE]
====
Be aware, that everytime raspi-config is executed and the serial shell is enabled, the /boot/cmdline.txt is rewritten with the serial console active again
====


[Versions before Raspbian Jessie] 
Open /etc/inittab and out comment the usage for ttyAMA0.

To do so add a *#* at the start of the line with ttyAMA0.
[source]
----
sudo nano /etc/inittab
----

[Versions after Raspbian Jessie]
With Raspbian Jessie, there is no inittab.

Instead, use raspi-config. In the Advanced options is 

A8 Serial Enable/Disable shell and kernel messages on the serial connection
[source]
----
sudo raspi-config
----

Reboot it.

[source]
----
sudo reboot
----

Make sure the user has the rights to access the ttyAMA0
[source]
----
# Check the group of the device
ls -l /dev/ttyAMA0
----

	crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 204, 64 Aug  4 11:33 /dev/ttyAMA0

[NOTE]
====
If the group is `tty` the device is still used be the kernel serial console, check your /boot/cmdline.txt to fix this and make sure the device is rebooted after modifying this file
====

[source]
----
# Add the user to the group seen above
sudo usermod -a -G dialout YOURUSERNAME
----



Reboot it. Now you could use the UART in your application.

[source]
----
reboot
----
